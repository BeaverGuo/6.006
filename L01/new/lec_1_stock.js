/*You are given an array A[0..n-1] of stock prices for
n consecutive days, and want to pick two days i0 and j0,
with 0 <= i0 <= j0 < n such if you buy a share of stock on day
i0 and sell it on day j0 you have maximum gain.  That is,
you want to maximize  A[j0] - A[i0].

The routines 'naive', 'dc', and 'lin' implement a naive
algorithm, a divide-and-conquer algorithm, and a linear-time
algorithm. 

These routines only return the maximum gain possible; they
don't return the days i0 and j0 that achieve this gain.

Exercise: modify these routines to output i0 and j0 as well.
